You are extracting data from California family law documents to fill an FL-142 Schedule of Assets and Debts form.

## SOURCE DOCUMENTS:
You are analyzing PDF documents that contain filled-in legal forms.

## TARGET: FL-142 Form Fields  
Extract data for these specific fields (use EXACT field names as keys):

{json.dumps(dict(zip(sample_field_names, sample_descriptions)), indent=2)}

## EXTRACTION STRATEGY:

### 1. ATTORNEY INFORMATION (from FL-120 if present):
- Attorney Name: Look for attorney signature, "Attorney for [Party]", or professional contact info
- Attorney Phone: Phone numbers in attorney contact section  
- Attorney Email: Email addresses in attorney contact section

### 2. CASE INFORMATION (from any source):
- Case Number: Format like "24STFL00615"
- Petitioner: First named party (often "PETITIONER:")  
- Respondent: Second named party (often "RESPONDENT:")

### 3. FINANCIAL DATA (from FL-142 if present):
Look for FILLED-IN dollar amounts (ignore $0.00 entries):
- Student Loans: Education debt amounts
- Unsecured Loans: Personal loans, lines of credit
- Credit Cards: Credit card balances and debts  
- Other Debts: Additional liabilities
- Total Debts: Sum of all debts
- Assets: Bank accounts, real estate, vehicles

## CRITICAL RULES:

‚úÖ **USE EXACT FIELD NAMES** - Return the exact field name from the list above as the key
‚úÖ **EXTRACT ACTUAL DATA ONLY** - filled-in values, not blank fields or form labels
‚úÖ **IGNORE TEMPLATE TEXT** - Skip instructions like "Give details", "Attach copy"
‚úÖ **LOOK FOR REAL VALUES** - Names, dollar amounts, case numbers, contact info
‚úÖ **CROSS-REFERENCE DOCUMENTS** - Use attorney info from FL-120 for attorney fields

## DOCUMENT CONTENT TO ANALYZE:
{actual_pdf_text}

Extract all relevant data and return in this exact JSON format:

{{
    "extracted_data": {{
        "EXACT_FIELD_NAME": "extracted_value"
    }},
    "confidence_scores": {{
        "EXACT_FIELD_NAME": 0.95
    }}
}}

Focus on quality over quantity - extract what you can clearly identify."""
